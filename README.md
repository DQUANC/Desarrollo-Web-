🌐 Web Development Repository

This repository contains my work and learning process for the Web Development course, covering the core pillars of modern web applications: Back-end, Front-end, and the integration between both layers.

The initial focus of this repository is Back-end development using C#, where I explore server-side logic, application architecture, data handling, and best practices for building scalable and maintainable systems.

As the course progresses, this repository will evolve to include Front-end development and the complete communication flow between client and server, providing a full-stack perspective on web application development.

📌 Topics Covered

- Back-end development with C#
- Server-side logic and architecture
- API design and data management
- Front-end fundamentals (coming soon)
- Client–server integration

🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my growth as a developer, apply theoretical concepts through practice, and build a strong foundation in full-stack web development.
